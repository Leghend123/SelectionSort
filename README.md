#SELECTION SORT ALGORITHM
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted region. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the sorting order) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

# WHY NEED SELECTION SORT

-Ease of Implementation
-Simplicity

# TIME COMPLEXITY

O(n^2)
